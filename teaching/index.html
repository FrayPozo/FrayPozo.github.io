During its development, terms such as force, stress, deformations, internal forces, beam flexure, deflection, beam design, among others, are covered. Stresses and deformations are determined in structural elements subjected to the simplest load levels, such as axial, transverse forces, and pure bending.

During its development, terms such as deformations, torsion, stress transformations, principal stresses, columns and energy methods are treated. The stresses and strains are determined in structural elements subjected to slightly more complex load levels such as axial, eccentric axial and torsional loads.

The influence lines of these structures are studied to determine unfavorable load conditions. The deformations in isostatic structures are found using energetic methods. At the end of the course, the force method is used to solve hyperstatic structures. The topics covered during the first phase of the course were the following. </p> <ol> <li>Loads on structures</li> <li>Statics Review</li> <li>Internal forces in isostatic structures</li> <li>Influence lines in isostatic structures</li> <li>Deformation computation using energetic methods</li> <li>Analysis of hyperstatic structures using the force method</li> </ol> <h3>Structural Analysis II (PUCMM &amp; UNIBE)</h3> <p align="justify"> In this course, methods of analysis of hyperstatic structures are developed to predict or evaluate the behavior of structures under different load requirements and their most unfavorable conditions. The skills acquired in this course are of special relevance for civil engineering professionals since it will allow them to obtain the necessary answers to design efficient structural solutions complying with current analysis and design regulations and customer requirements.

Additionally, the effects of seismic displacements in structures and their impact on current regulations are studied. With the above, it is sought that the student develops skills that allow a better understanding of the effects of seismic events for their consideration in the analysis and design in order to design safe buildings. By understanding dynamic loads and their effects, the students will be able to properly apply tools, codes, and specifications to proposed structural systems.</p> <ol> <li>Basics of dynamics</li> <li>Dynamic systems of one degree of freedom</li> <li>Numerical evaluation of the dynamic response</li> <li>Earthquakes, seismograms, accelerograms and spectra</li> <li>Multi-degrees of freedom systems</li> <li>Introduction to seismic design parameters</li> </ol> <h2><b>Graduate Level</b></h2> <h3>Numerical Methods (UASD)</h3> <p align="justify"> This course will be designed so that students can have the ability to develop computational algorithms and use programs, made by the students, to carry out the analysis and calculations required for the different subjects during the development of the graduate program.
